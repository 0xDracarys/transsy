C++ program that can translate text from one language to another

To create a program in C++ that can translate text from one language to another,
you will need to use a translation API. There are several translation APIs available,
such as the Google Translate API, the Microsoft Translator Text API, and the Amazon Translate API.

the program uses the cURL library to make a POST request to the Google Translate API.
The API key, source language, target language, and text to be translated are specified as parameters in the request.
The response from the API is a JSON string that contains the translated text.
